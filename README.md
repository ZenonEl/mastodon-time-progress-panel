    *   Progress bar for the current day.
    *   Progress bar for the current month.
    *   Progress bar for the current year.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Install a UserScript Manager:** You'll need a browser extension such as:
    *   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
    *   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    *   [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox)
2.  **Install the Script:**
    *   Go to the [installation link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenonEl/mastodon-time-progress-panel/main/mastodon-time-progress-panel.user.js).
    *   Your UserScript manager should automatically prompt you to install the script. Click "Install".

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

After installing the script, you can customize the progress bar colors through your UserScript manager's command menu (e.g., by clicking the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar):

*   **Panel Settings: Enter custom RED accent color (hex):**
    Allows you to change the color of the progress bar for "This Day".
*   **Panel Settings: Enter custom GREEN accent color (hex):**
    Allows you to change the color of the progress bar for "This Month".
*   **Panel Settings: Enter custom PURPLE accent color (hex):**
    Allows you to change the color of the progress bar for "This Year".

Enter the desired color in hexadecimal format (e.g., `#FF0000` or `#F00`).

## ‚úÖ Compatibility

The script has been tested and should work on most modern Mastodon instances.
The primary tested `@match` rules include:
*   `https://mastodon.ml/*`
*   `https://fosstodon.org/*`

Theoretically, it should work on any Mastodon instance that uses a standard DOM structure and CSS variables.

**Browsers:**
*   Chrome (with Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey)
*   Firefox (with Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey)
*   Edge (with Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey)
*   Opera (with Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey)
*   And other browsers that support WebExtensions and UserScript managers.
